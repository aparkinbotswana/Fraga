# FRÅGA

The FRÅGA app is a collaboration to make a social app. The concept behind the app is to allow users to post any sort of question and attach a geographical tag to the question. Users within geographical vicinity of the posted question will be able to see the question and post an answer to it.

Our live, [Fraga](https://fraqa.herokuapp.com) site can be found here.

Additional contributors to this project were: Michelle Lo, Julian Treweeke and Andy Brown.
