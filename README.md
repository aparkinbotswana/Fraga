# FRÅGA

The FRÅGA app is a collaboration to make a social app. The concept behind the app is to allow users to post any sort of question and attach a geographical tag to the question. Users within geographical vicinity of the posted question will be able to see the question and post an answer to it.

Our live, [Fraga](https://fraga-app.herokuapp.com) site can be found here.

## Features

- Users can set their geographical location when searching for and creating posts.
- Voting on posts and comments.
- Emoji markers to display your question on Google maps.
- Translation of posts from other languages.

## Bugs
- User have to manually type their location in the location search bar to view questions in their area. A geolocation column must be added to the User model to fix this issue.
